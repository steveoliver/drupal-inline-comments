This module simply lets you add the "Inline Comments" field  to your view and  boom  - you have inline ajax  comments somewhat like a basic version  of Facebook commenting. You probably want to set preview to optional, limit the number of comments per page and set comment subjects to disabled.  This is not designed to work with Captcha or other spam prevention solutions so you probably  do not want to allow anonymous users post comments.
